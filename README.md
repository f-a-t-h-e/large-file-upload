# Large File Upload

## Description

This is a simple way of implementing file upload for large files with the ability to pause/resume the uploading process accidently or willingly.

## Motivation

Developers usually need to handle file upload in their projects, so I wanted to add a simple solution to help myself and others.

## Notes

You can/should improve several parts of this code, it's just for demonstrating the idea
